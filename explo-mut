To transfer files from your local Windows machine to a remote server, WinSCP is a popular GUI-based tool that supports SFTP, SCP, FTP, and WebDAV.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to install and use WinSCP:

✅ Step 1: Download and Install WinSCP
Go to the official WinSCP website.

Download the Installation package (not the portable one).

Run the installer and follow the prompts:

Choose Typical Installation.

Interface Style: Choose Commander (default and recommended).

✅ Step 2: Connect to Your Server
Open WinSCP.

In the Login window, enter the following:

File protocol: SFTP (or SCP or FTP depending on what your server supports)

Host name: your.server.ip.address or your.domain.com

Port number: 22 (for SFTP/SCP) or 21 (for FTP)

Username: your_server_username

Password: your_password (or configure key-based auth)

🔐 Optional: For SSH Key login,

Click Advanced > SSH > Authentication

Browse and select your private key file (e.g., .ppk or .pem)

Click Save (optional), then Login.

✅ Step 3: Transfer Files
On the left: Your local system.

On the right: Your remote server.

Simply drag and drop files between panes to upload/download.

💡 Useful Tips
You can also set file/folder permissions post-upload.

Use "Keep remote directory up to date" (under Commands) for live sync.

Command-line automation is available using the WinSCP.com scripting interface.
