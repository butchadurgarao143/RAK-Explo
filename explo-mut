https://winscp.net/eng/download.php
To transfer files from your local Windows machine to a remote server, WinSCP is a popular GUI-based tool that supports SFTP, SCP, FTP, and WebDAV.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to install and use WinSCP:

✅ Step 1: Download and Install WinSCP
Go to the official WinSCP website.

Download the Installation package (not the portable one).

Run the installer and follow the prompts:

Choose Typical Installation.

Interface Style: Choose Commander (default and recommended).

✅ Step 2: Connect to Your Server
Open WinSCP.

In the Login window, enter the following:

File protocol: SFTP (or SCP or FTP depending on what your server supports)

Host name: your.server.ip.address or your.domain.com

Port number: 22 (for SFTP/SCP) or 21 (for FTP)

Username: your_server_username

Password: your_password (or configure key-based auth)

🔐 Optional: For SSH Key login,

Click Advanced > SSH > Authentication

Browse and select your private key file (e.g., .ppk or .pem)

Click Save (optional), then Login.

✅ Step 3: Transfer Files
On the left: Your local system.

On the right: Your remote server.

Simply drag and drop files between panes to upload/download.

💡 Useful Tips
You can also set file/folder permissions post-upload.

Use "Keep remote directory up to date" (under Commands) for live sync.

Command-line automation is available using the WinSCP.com scripting interface.

Here’s a comprehensive list of tailored interview answers for the Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) role based on the JD you've provided. These will help you respond confidently to technical and behavioral interview questions.

✅ 1. Kubernetes and Container Orchestration
Q: How do you deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters on AWS or hybrid environments?
A:
I primarily use Amazon EKS for Kubernetes clusters on AWS. For hybrid environments, I have experience with tools like Rancher and Cluster API. Deployment is often automated using Terraform or AWS CDK. I ensure high availability by distributing worker nodes across multiple AZs and using autoscaling groups. For monitoring cluster health, I use kubectl, Prometheus, and Grafana dashboards.

Q: How do you manage and optimize Kubernetes cluster scaling and costs?
A:
I use Karpenter for dynamic provisioning of nodes, which helps reduce over-provisioning and optimize resource costs. I configure node selectors and taints to place workloads efficiently. For cost visibility, I tag Kubernetes workloads and use AWS Cost Explorer or Kubecost to analyze and optimize usage.

✅ 2. Cloud and Hybrid Infrastructure Management
Q: Can you explain your experience managing cloud infrastructure?
A:
I have hands-on experience with AWS services like EC2, EKS, RDS, S3, IAM, VPC, and CloudWatch. For hybrid setups, I’ve integrated OpenStack with AWS using VPNs and Direct Connect. I manage infrastructure using IaC tools like Terraform and Ansible, and I implement CI/CD for infrastructure deployment using Jenkins and GitHub Actions.

Q: How do you optimize cloud costs?
A:
I regularly use AWS Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor, and Compute Optimizer. I configure Savings Plans and Reserved Instances where workloads are predictable. For containerized workloads, I recommend Karpenter or Fargate Spot. I also implement policies for shutting down unused resources and tag everything for cost tracking.

✅ 3. Monitoring and Reliability
Q: What monitoring stack have you used?
A:
I’ve worked with Prometheus + Grafana for infrastructure metrics and custom app monitoring. On AWS, I integrate CloudWatch Logs, Metrics, and Alarms. I use Loki or ELK stack for log aggregation. For alerting, I use Alertmanager, Slack integrations, and PagerDuty.

Q: Describe how you conduct RCA for a production issue.
A:
First, I check monitoring dashboards to identify anomalies or spikes. I correlate logs and metrics around the failure timeline. I trace dependencies and use tools like Jaeger for distributed tracing. I document the incident in a post-mortem with contributing factors and corrective actions, then automate fixes to avoid recurrence.

✅ 4. CI/CD Pipelines
Q: What tools do you use to implement CI/CD pipelines?
A:
I’ve built pipelines using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and ArgoCD. For containerized apps, I automate Docker image builds, vulnerability scans (using tools like Trivy), Helm chart packaging, and deploy to EKS. I use staged environments with promotion gates, and automate rollbacks with health checks.

Q: How do you ensure safe deployments?
A:
I use canary and blue-green deployment strategies. Health probes, readiness checks, and circuit breakers are in place. I also implement automated testing stages, such as linting, unit tests, and integration tests, before the deployment step.

✅ 5. Security and Compliance
Q: How do you integrate security into the DevOps lifecycle? (DevSecOps)
A:
I integrate SAST and DAST tools like SonarQube and OWASP ZAP into pipelines. Secrets are stored in HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes secrets encrypted with KMS. I enforce least privilege using IAM policies and RBAC in Kubernetes. I also automate compliance checks using tools like Inspec and AWS Config.

Q: How do you handle secret management?
A:
I use Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to centrally store, rotate, and audit secrets. Applications access secrets via IAM roles or sidecar containers. I avoid storing secrets in code and enable envelope encryption with KMS.

✅ 6. Cost Optimization and Governance
Q: How do you implement governance policies for cost-effective infrastructure?
A:
I enforce tagging policies for all resources and monitor usage via AWS Config rules and Budgets. I automate idle resource cleanup and use tools like Cloud Custodian. I also enforce infrastructure provisioning via Terraform modules with pre-approved configurations to avoid over-provisioning.

✅ 7. General and Behavioral Questions
Q: What makes you a good SRE?
A:
I bring a balance of software engineering and infrastructure management. I focus on automation, reliability, and proactive monitoring. My strengths include troubleshooting production issues, writing efficient CI/CD pipelines, and implementing scalable and cost-effective infrastructure. I follow a culture of continuous improvement and collaboration with development teams.

Q: Tell me about a challenging incident and how you resolved it.
A:
In one incident, our EKS cluster ran out of IP addresses, causing pod failures. I identified the issue via CloudWatch and Prometheus alerts, scaled the subnet CIDRs using CloudFormation, and modified the CNI config to support secondary IP ranges. Post-fix, I added monitoring and alerts for ENI/IP usage to prevent recurrence.
